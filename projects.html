                        We learned some basic HTML and how to utilize Git to push projects to GitHub.

                        We had to branch a repository provided by Code:You, correct it so that it was using the correct semantic tags, and then push it to GitHub.

                        For this project we could choose to do what we wanted to practice the concepts we've learned so far. I chose a form because it seemed like a good way to start understanding HTML beyond the initial elements. I also tried applying CSS to see how it affects the forms appearance.
